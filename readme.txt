One click Ultimate LinkedIn Integration/Registration, Buddy Press Integration, profile syncing, and more...

== Description ==
Ultimate LinkedIn Integration is the most advanced integration between LinkedIn and WordPress.

This is the **only** plugin that gives your WordPress website the ability to integrate with LinkedIn’s API.

### **MAJOR FEATURES** ###

Create and customize your WordPress site with Ultimate LinkedIn Integration which will help you to:

* Map BuddyPress custom fields to LinkedIn profile fields
* Allow users to register/login with their LinkedIn account using one click
* Lock content and make it available to users who have logged in using LinkedIn only. Users who have logged in via other methods won’t be able to see it.
* Enter custom redirect URLs upon Sign-up, Login and Authorization Cancellation

### **ADDITIONAL FEATURES** ###

Ultimate LinkedIn Integration also helps you with these useful built-in features:

* Ability to request custom scopes upon authentication 
(Basic profile and email address are asked for by default, Sharing and Company Admin scopes are optional)
* Ability to sync user data the first time user signs up, or every time they login.
* Option to override the user’s profile picture with LinkedIn’s profile picture
* Ability to keep the user logged in, or require them to login every time.

### **GET STARTED** ###

Installation is free, quick, and easy. Just follow this [Installation Guide](http://thoughtengineer.com/docs/ultimate-linkedin-login/installation/).
