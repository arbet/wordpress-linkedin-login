Allows your WordPress website visitors to login using their LinkedIn account.  

== Description ==
This plugin gives your WordPress website the ability to allow users to login/register via their LinkedIn account. 

List of features:

* Users can register with their LinkedIn account using one click
* For people who are already registered, the LinkedIn plugin automatically logs them in, by matching the email address associated with their LinkedIn account with the user\'s email address inside WordPress. 
* Just enter your LinkedIn API Key and Secret Key, under the settings page and you\'re ready to go!
* User's First Name and Last Name are automatically updated from LinkedIn
* Use the shortcode [wpli_login_link] to display the sign in link anywhere on your site.
* You can use [wpli_login_link text='Your Custom Link Text'] to generate a sign-in link with your own text.
* [wpli_login_link redirect = 'http://example.com/your-redirect-page'] will redirect the user to a certain URL after login
* [wpli_login_link class = 'class1 class2'] will add the corresponding CSS classes to the generated link
